<p>
We get to Witu and load lapdesks on our cars then set off again, driving deeper into the heartland<br> of Lamu until we get off the road and drive further into the interior. Poverty that had been subtly<br> rising all around us becomes more bold. There are less and less children wearing shoes then less<br> and less adults wearing shoes. Houses turn into mud huts and tin roofs become browner, then<br> they turn into grass.
<br><br>
We stop at our first school. It’s not even a school. It’s two blocks of mud houses, with gaping holes<br> in the walls. There are no doors. No desks. No seats. Children cluster together curiously, these<br> dirty children with torn clothes hanging from their bodies like they survived a bomb explosion,<br> which is what poverty seems like, an explosion. And it singes your conscience. The boys have<br> pieces of clothes for belts. The girl’s uniforms are so torn they have to wear other old clothes<br> underneath to remain decent. I shudder to think of the ones getting into puberty and dealing with<br> menses. Almost all have barefeet. The teachers, these poor professionals who are entrusted with<br> raising a generation, don’t look any better than the children they educate; they look resigned,<br> hanging onto a very thin sliver of intention. They sit silently under trees marking dog-eared books.<br> All around us, poverty stares back at you with unblinking snake eyes.
<br><br>
The headmaster gathers his cast of desperados. We hand them these lap desks called the<br> Tutudesk, these improvised desks that children from poor schools without desks can use to read <br>and write from. Easier to write on them than balancing your book from your knees. We also hand<br> them special footballs that don’t deflate, which seem to excite them more than the desks because<br> they are children after all. A few scatter off to play, laughing. Group pictures are taken. Someone<br> gives a small touching speech while squinting in the sun. The children clap for us and it evokes<br> such guilt in me, I turn away. We don’t deserve the claps, they do, for their stoicity.
<br><br>
We bundle in our cars, an entourage of four, and off we go back into the bushes and narrow paths<br> that we came from.
<br><br>
We have five schools to visit, a whole day’s work, then we have another six schools in rural Kilifi.  In<br> total, we have 4,000 lap desks to deliver and hundreds of balls to give away. At the schools, I try to<br> talk to the children; “What is your name?” How many children are you in the family? Do you like Arsenal<br> or Man-United? What would you like to be when you grow up? How old are you? Can you remember<br> when you were last happiest? Who is your best friend? Why are they your best friend, what do you like<br> about them?  When did you last dream and what did you dream about?  I’m shooting in the dark,<br> looking for an angle, a  narrative, that elusive golden thread, but the children have the confidence<br> of a fridge magnet; poverty has subdued them, held their confidence in a headlock until it’s turning<br> red in the eyes. They don’t know how to engage me, they are weighed down by an inferiority <br>complex, they see me as a unicorn, a completely different animal from them because I have shoes<br> and they don’t. I constantly come up short. They stare at me blank-faced.
<br><br>
I mostly watch them play. Or I stand at the back and watch the team give another ball, another<br> lapdesk and give another speech and take another picture that elicits another applause.
<br><br>
Funny things happen. For instance, after a lapdesk is handed one of the drivers says to the gathered:
<br><br>
“Isuzu!”
<br><br>
The children all scream together laughing, “Tosha!”
<br><br>
“Isuzu?”
<br><br>
“Tosha!”
<br><br>
“Jameni nyinyi ni vibogoyo? Mbona hamna raha, aah, jameni?
<br><br>
The children giggle.
<br><br>
“Isuzu?”
<br><br>
“TOSHAAAA!”
<br><br>
That shit makes me so happy.
<br><br>
Then we pile in our cars and we move to the next school.
<br><br>
At the next school, Bora Moyo Primary School – one mud-walled block, a toilet, a small open<br> kitchen, a big football field – we gather in a principal’s office. He shows us the free laptops from<br> the government of Kenya. He’s holding them like you would a human skull at Kariandusi<br> prehistoric site. Like it might detonate. I’m amazed that the free-laptop project actually kicked-off <br>even though the schools have no power to power those laptops.
<br><br>
Children are now gathering near the principal’s office. Handymen are offloading the lapdesks and the balls.
<br><br>
Behind me, Duncan Muhindi of General Motors is giving another speech while holding one of the lapdesks. <br>A horde of children are gathered around him, eyeing the balls. The teachers are all grinning, hands held behind their backs.
<br><br>
Behind me, our driver is saying,
<br><br>
“Isuzu?”
<br><br>
“Tosha!”
<br><br>
“Isuzu?”
<br><br>
“Tosha”
<br><br>
“Ahh, jameni, watoto wapendwa, nyinyi wanyonge kweli? Hamna nguvu?”
<br><br>
Giggles.
<br><br>
“Isuzu?”
<br><br>
“TOSHAAAA!”
<br><br>
If these kids ever grow up and buy a Ford truck, it would be the greatest travesty of our times, I<br> think to myself.
<br><br>
We pile back into cars and off we go through narrow sandy roads, through small patches of<br> grassland, through small sleepy centers where blank-faced men in shukas sit lethargically under<br> trees.
<br><br>
We are at Moa Primary school now. Muhindi is standing on a football to show how resilient and<br> durable the balls are. The ball deflates but once he steps off it, it goes back to its shape. The<br> children gathered to stare in awe at this magic ball! He hands out lapdesks to another group of<br> children, explaining in surprisingly fluent Swahili how the desks work. Behind the school,<br> somewhere in the bushes, the biggest lake in the County, Lake Witu flows unbothered by these<br> new visitors.
<br><br>
The team is now taking pictures with the teachers and children.
<br><br>
We get to Kilifi after eight pm, bone tired. My room in Kilifi Bay Beach Resort doesn’t have running<br> water in the shower, and no phone in the room, so I have to drag my weary self all the way to the<br> reception and ask to be moved to a new room. I fall asleep under a mosquito net. The AC at 30.
<br><br>
The next morning we are off into the heartland of Kilifi. Kilifi is wonderful and scenic. At the next<br> school in Ganze subcounty, we give out desks. I peer into the mud-classes and it’s heartbreaking;<br> they sit on small pieces of wood set against stones. The floor is dusty. School bags that are plastic<br> bags hang from pegs against the mudwall. There are holes in the wall, as in if you are seated at the<br> back of the classroom and the class is boring you can sneak out of class while the teacher writes<br> on the board and he wouldn’t notice. It’s a heartbreaking way to learn.
<br><br>
The children take one of the balls and run off to the football pitch behind the block. Duncan hands <br>out desks and shakes the hand of their headmaster. A journalist pulls aside one of the teachers for<br> an interview. I lean under a tree and stare at the children laughing and chasing the ball. Amazing<br> how even in this desperation they are able to quickly find pockets of unbridled laughter.
<br><br>
Pictures are taken. The chaps from PLAN International grin. The teachers grin. The journalists grin. Grins all over.
<br><br>
“Isuzu?”
<br><br>
“Tosha!”
<br><br>
“Ahh, hii shule ya Dulukiza imejaa vibogoyo kweli! Changamkeni majameni!”
<br><br>
The teachers and kids laugh.
<br><br>
“Isuzu!”
<br><br>
“TOSHAAAA!”  I also say loudly,
<br><br>
They have brainwashed me. I will come back to Nairobi, sell my car and buy a DMax and drive it<br> around in a stetson hat and tell everyone that now I’m rearing pigs.
<br><br>
We are getting back in the cars. It’s starting to drizzle. The children are off to play football in the<br> rain.
